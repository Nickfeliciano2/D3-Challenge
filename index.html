          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks vs Age/Income/and Poverty</h2>
          <p>Looking at the data, it appears Obesity has a negative sloped correlation as the states with a higher percentile of obesity are also the lowest household incomes.
             Obesity hits mostly around the late 30’s, and the more impoverished states have the higher obese percent’s as well.  
            </p>

          <p>Smoking seems to have the same trends as obesity, poorer household Income states seem to have more smokers.
             Obesity is a higher percentile though, with smoking ranging in the 10-30% range while obesity is at the 22-40% range in all states.

          </p>

          <p>
            It seems that Lacking healthcare is even across the ranges, as the % varies and does not appear to have a correlation.
             It does seem to trend that the poorer you are the more likely you are to not have healthcare, but it does not appear that age affects this very much.
